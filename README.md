## The project

nonce-words-data-parser
=======================

Simple parsing of data for a research project centered on nonce (nonsense) words. Uses a hosted site on gdrive.

Assumes a decent web browser.

## File notes
*irregular_verbs.txt* was taken from http://www.online-languages.info/english/irregular_verbs.php?l=1 and made all lowercase.

Ordering of columns is as follows:  
Base form	Past simple		Past participle		3rd person singular		Present participle Gerund

Formatting: some words in the right 4 columns have slashes like "besought/beseeched"
