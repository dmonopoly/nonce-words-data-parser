## The project

nonce-words-data-parser
=======================

Simple parsing of data for a research project centered on nonce (nonsense) words. Uses a hosted site on gdrive.

Assumes a decent web browser.

## File notes
*irregular_verbs list* was taken from http://www.online-languages.info/english/irregular_verbs.php?l=1 and made all lowercase.


## Little things not taken of
Technically verb reader does not deal with the slash yet as in "was/were"
